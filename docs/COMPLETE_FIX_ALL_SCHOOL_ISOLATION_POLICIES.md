# Complete Fix for All Broken School Isolation Policies

## The Problem
All school isolation policies use `auth.jwt()->>'profile_id'` which is NULL.
This means no policies are evaluated = everything is allowed.

## The Solution  
Replace with `(SELECT school_id FROM public.user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())` 
This correctly gets the user's school_id for proper isolation.

## Expected Results After Running

Your MFA Policy Tester should show:
- **Before**: `0/46 tables correctly blocked`
- **After**: `40+/46 tables correctly blocked`

## What This Fixes

✅ **School Isolation**: Proper user-to-school mapping  
✅ **MFA Enforcement**: All policies include MFA checks  
✅ **Column Security**: `user_profiles` uses secure function  
✅ **Database Security**: Cannot be bypassed from application

**Run this script as SUPERUSER, then test your MFA Policy Enforcement again!**
