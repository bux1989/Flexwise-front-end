## Suggestions for Redesigning Sticky Columns Approach

1. **Mimic Excel Behavior**: Implement a system where sticky columns behave similarly to Excel. This would involve having a fixed sidebar that remains in place while the rest of the table can be scrolled. 

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure that the sticky columns have a clear separation from the main content. This can be achieved by creating separate components for the sticky columns and the main table, allowing for better control of their behavior.

3. **Avoid Sticky Table Cells**: Using sticky table cells can lead to overlapping issues, like day numbers bleeding through. Instead, consider using fixed positioning for the sticky headers and columns, which will prevent this overlap.

4. **Responsive Design**: Make sure that the sticky columns are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes, maintaining usability across devices.

5. **Testing for Overlap Issues**: Rigorously test the new implementation to ensure that there are no overlap issues when resizing the window or changing the layout, especially for edge cases.
